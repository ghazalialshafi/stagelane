## stagelane/core — runtime heart of the continuation machinery.
##
## A *continuation* is a heap object (`Frame` or a subtype) holding the live
## state of a suspended computation plus `fn`, the next "stage" to execute.
## Stages are plain `nimcall` procs `proc (env: pointer): Hop`; running a
## continuation means calling its stage, which returns the *next step*: a
## `(stage, env)` pair held in two registers.  The `drive` loops on that.
##
## Ownership: a live continuation is owned by exactly one *pin* -- a raw
## pointer that is handed from holder to holder (ready queue, wait queue,
## timer wheel, fd table, the stage that is running).  Moving a pin costs
## nothing: no refcount traffic on any hop.  `finish` releases the pin, which
## frees the environment and everything it holds.  `caller` is a raw pointer to
## the caller, which is itself pinned for as long as the callee runs.
